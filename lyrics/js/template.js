    Active listening is a powerful practice, allowing the speaker to feel validated, heard, and respected. Although seemingly simple, this kind of listening is a skill that must be practiced, and runs somewhat counter to the way that western society operates. Societies valuing individualization can lead to an emphasis on presentation and appearance fueled by social media, algorithms, and increasing interconnectivity. There has been more pressure that could drive individuals towards focusing on the self, and becoming more given to turning attention inward at the expense of remaining present in order to monitor how they are being received. Active listening is based on three core tenets, and below I will discuss my understanding of them, as well as how these can be applied to branching narrative in order to create a fulfilling and developing experience. For a more in-depth exploration of active listening, please see <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Listening-Well-Art-Empathic-Understanding/dp/1532634846" target="_blank">Listening Well - The Art of Empathic Understanding by William R. Miller</a></br></br>. Active listening can be broken down into reflection, open questions, and non-judgmental curiosity. While commonly associated with therapy, coaching, and managerial practices, it is something that can be beneficial when adopted as a lifestyle rather than a technique applied within the confines of an occupation. Building rapport is the first step, where you begin to form a connection, relating to the individual, and meeting them where they are, validating their experiences and perspective without judgment. It is commonly remarked that people tend to become defensive when challenged. This is the case when there is not adequate relationship development, and they feel attacked rather than safe. People will react similarly when they sense they are being controlled and manipulated. When a player feels that their choice is false, and does not matter, this is a feeling of invalidation and helplessness. Although in a game, it isn't feasible for each character to foster such a relationship, it makes sense for some relationships to develop over time. Once validation and invalidation are kept in mind, it is also possible to foster that kind of relationship in a meta aspect through the game systems and overarching conversations. The players will detect whether the game seems to respect and respond to their actions and choices.</br></br>One of the most important aspects of active listening is reflection, which is simply repeating what was said back at the speaker, being mindful of the degree to which the words are mirrored. By reflecting in this way, it either makes the speaker feel heard and understood, or it gives them an opportunity to clarify and correct if necessary. In the event that the reflection was accurate, it encourages them to continue, elaborating on the subject and deepening understanding. Reflection is best served as a statement, as a question holds implicit expectation and can often be felt as aggressive, while the statement does not hold such a feeling. There are many examples of this, such as the felt difference in the following examples:</br></br><pre>    You were upset with your family?</pre></br></br></pre><pre>    You were upset with your family.</pre></br></br>Generally, taking a question, 'lopping off' the beginning question demarcation, and replacing the question mark with a period is effective in changing how it is perceived. This can be combined with minor extrapolation, such as 'Of course you were upset with your family, it makes sense that you would feel less inclined to go out this weekend'. This continuation of their line of thinking shows that you are interested and engaged with their line of conversation, and allows them to either accept the addition as a jumping off point to continue, or to correct something, which will also further exploration of  that line of dialog.</br></br>By applying this kind of thinking to branching narrative design, it can make the player feel they are driving things, and that their choices matter by driving the conversation, and having a natural progression, following the thread that is important to them in the moment. This can be combined with the planting and payoff of choices made in the past to give a more fulfilling experience.</br></br> Open questions are another important aspect of active listening, where the prompted question is stated in a way that does not lead the player. Although it isn't possible to allow players to respond in an open manner in most cases to the questions posed, narrative structure can still be designed with this in mind, posing things and offering choices that feel different enough while remaining relevant to the player and context. Contrast the two following scenarios.</br></br> What weapon would you like to use? </br></br><pre>    A sword, a mace, or a wand.</pre></br></br>How do you deal with aggression?</br></br>     <pre>    By taking up arms, by fleeing with haste, by slipping into the shadows.</pre></br></br>These are not perfect examples of the discrete closed vs open questions, as closed questions provide limited choices, while open questions allow freedom for the speaker to elaborate. Nonetheless, even though branching narrative is often somewhat limited to closed choices, it is not the case that they are all created equal. In the above, I would posit that the second question has a greater degree of openness relative to the first. The first example makes more assumptions by assuming  a violent response, and that a specific kind of weapon is favored. Although there are choices for a response, it doesn't feel as expressive when the choice is merely which kind of implement would you prefer to attack an aggressor with. In presenting the information as a more removed question, it allows for an answer that feels more expressive and less manipulated.</br></br>Active listening can be an interesting frame in which to view narrative design. Not only can it be used to make the player feel more validated and consequential in the narrative,  building out possible responses with this in mind can also yield fruitful results. There are common reactions to conversations, and if we use these as the basis of our choices, then we can allow them to predictably lead to similar results in the conversation path without being too overt about it. For instance, offering choices in response to a given prompt as reflective, deflective, and dismissive could lead to a combination of natural conversation flow and an intuitive control built into the dialog system. </br></br>I'm not concerned about where you were last night, I'm concerned about the two dead guards at the front gate!</br></br><pre>    The guards are more important to you than my whereabouts. Anyone would feel the same in your position. (reflective, validating)</pre></br></br><pre>    If you were really concerned, you would be out doing something rather than talking to me. (deflective, defensive)</pre></br></br><pre>    I'm just trying to get home and rest, I'm exhausted. Just let me by. (dismissive)</pre></br></br>The first response would facilitate the guard to continue, and allow for the sharing of more information, going deeper into what they are concerned about, what they are thinking, and how they are perceiving things. The second response, which is more deflective, would raise suspicious and cause the guard to be defensive in return, making them more closed-off and aggressive. The dismissive response would not cause the same level of aggression and counter response, however the guard would not be forthcoming. There are alternatives for the ways this would play out, but this displays the ways in which this kind of thinking can help to guide constructing a developing narrative that feels more rewarding and intuitive when used from both positions. Please note that this is similar to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vRfNtvFVRo" target="_blank">Accept, Reject, Deflect method by Jon Ingold</a> of Inkle, although I feel this has a bit of a different feel to it. The differences in practice may reveal themselves in subtle ways, such as the overall experience of watching something that is developed using the three-act structure versus 起承転結(kishoutenketsu). Applying active listening to narrative dialog can result in more fulfilling and rewarding storytelling experiences.</br></br>
